  abstract = {This paper presents a novel trajectory planning method for a flexible Cartesian robot manipulator in a point-to-point motion. In order to obtain an exact mathematical model, the parameters of the equation of motion are determined from an identification experiment. An artificial neural network is employed to generate the desired base position, and then, a particle swarm optimization technique is used as the learning algorithm, in which the sum of the displacements of the manipulator is chosen as the objective function. We show that the residual vibrations of the manipulator can be suppressed by minimizing the displacement of the manipulator. The effectiveness and validity of the proposed method are demonstrated by comparing the simulation and experimental results.},

It is difficult to detect defects in CPS models due to the complexities involved in the software and physical systems. To find defects in CPS models efficiently, robustness guided falsification of CPS is introduced. Existing methods use several optimization techniques to generate counterexamples, which falsify the given properties of a CPS. However those methods may require a large number of simulation runs to find the counterexample and is far from practical.

Currently, deep learning is enabling reinforcement learning (RL) to scale to problems that were previously intractable, such as learning to play video games directly from pixels. DRL algorithms are also applied to robotics, allowing control policies for robots to be learned directly from camera inputs in the real world. In this survey, we begin with an introduction to the general field of RL, then progress to the main streams of value-based and policy-based methods. Our survey will cover central algorithms in deep RL, including the deep Q-network (DQN), trust region policy optimization (TRPO), and asynchronous advantage actor critic. In parallel, we highlight the unique advantages of deep neural networks, focusing on visual understanding via RL. To conclude, we describe several current areas of research within the field.},

Review, discussion and analysis of optimization techniques to find the optimal trajectory either in Cartesian space or joint space are presented and investigated. Optimal trajectory selection approaches such as kinematics and dynamics techniques with various constraints are presented and explained. Although the kinematics approach is simple and straight forward, it will experience some problems in implementation because of lack of Inertia and torque constraints. The application of Genetic Algorithms to find the optimal trajectory of manipulators especially in the obstacle avoidance is also highlighted. Combining the Genetic Algorithms with other classical optimization methods proves to have better performance as a hybrid optimization technique.},

The problem of planning suitable trajectories is relevant not only for the proper use of these machines, in order to avoid undesired e?ects such as vibrations or even damages on the mech- ical structure, but also in some phases of their design and in the choice and sizing of the actuators. This is particularly true now that the concept of “el- tronic cams” has replaced, in the design of automatic machines, the classical approach based on “mechanical cams”. The choice of a particular trajectory has direct and relevant implications on several aspects of the design and use of an automatic machine, like the dimensioning of the actuators and of the reduction gears, the vibrations and e?orts generated on the machine and on the load, the tracking errors during the motion execution. For these reasons, in order to understand and appreciate the peculiarities of the di?erent techniques available for trajectory planning, besides the ma- ematical aspects of their implementation also a detailed analysis in the time and frequency domains, a comparison of their main properties under di?erent points of view, and general considerations related to their practical use are reported.},

The first algorithm is a simple Inverse Kinematics (IK) Unity code that considers up to 9 points on the human body to model the motion. The second algorithm is the BIO IK that can consider up to 38 points. The performance of the algorithms is compared with data obtained by a Motion Capture (MoCap) measurement system. The metric of accuracy was used to quantify the performance evaluation and was modeled as the error of the position of the modeled joints of a human avatar with those measured by the MoCap system. It is observed that the obtained accuracy of the position increases with the number of points that is considered by the IK algorithm. For the purpose of this investigation, a MoCap system based on 13 cameras and 38 markers on the human body was used to measure the location of the joints of a human operator performing specific motions. The motion of lifting was the epicenter of the investigation that causes the larger amount of accidents in typical manufacturing facilities. The application of this research falls within the concepts of Digital Twin (DT) in Industry 4.0 scenarios.},

  abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) has been used in a range of simulated real-world tasks, e.g., sensor coordination, traffic light control, and on-demand mobility services. However, real world deployments are rare, as RL struggles with dynamic nature of real world environments, requiring time for learning a task and adapting to changes in the environment. Transfer Learning (TL) can help lower these adaptation times. In particular, there is a significant potential of applying TL in multi-agent RL systems, where multiple agents can share knowledge with each other, as well as with new agents that join the system. To obtain the most from inter-agent transfer, transfer roles (i.e., determining which agents act as sources and which as targets), as well as relevant transfer content parameters (e.g., transfer size) should be selected dynamically in each particular situation. As a first step towards fully dynamic transfers, in this paper we investigate the impact of TL transfer parameters with fixed source and target roles. Specifically, we label every agent-environment interaction with agent's epistemic confidence, and we filter the shared examples using varying threshold levels and sample sizes. We investigate impact of these parameters in two scenarios, a standard predator-prey RL benchmark and a simulation of a ride-sharing system with 200 vehicle agents and 10,000 ride-requests.},

The Equations of motion of the robot manipulator are determined using Lagrange formulation. In order to accomplish a desired trajectory, the displacements of the revolute joints are interpolated as polynomial functions of time. The proposed approach generates the trajectory for the manipulator joints and end-effector by minimizing total power consumption by taking the kinematic, dynamic constraints and the obstacles in the workspace in to account. The methodology is illustrated using a planar 3-Degrees of Freedom (DOF) robot using two types of motion planning simulations; point to point motion and continuous path motion planning. Simulation results have been reported for the joint trajectories, end–effector motion for the above two cases. Results of joint trajectories are smooth and efficient.},

It consists of linking two points in the operational space while minimizing a cost function, taking into account dynamic equations of motion as well as bounds on joint positions, velocities, jerks and torques. This generic optimal control problem is transformed, via a clamped cubic spline model of joint temporal evolutions, into a non-linear constrained optimization problem which is treated then by the Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) method. Applications involving grasping mobile object or obstacle avoidance are shown to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed planner.},

  abstract = {The goal of this paper is to present experimental results on the implementation of the damped least-squares method for the six-joint ABB IRb2000 industrial robot manipulator. A number of inverse kinematics schemes are reviewed which allow robot control through kinematic singularities. The basic scheme adopts a damped least-squares inverse of the manipulator Jacobian with a varying damping factor acting in the neighborhood of singularities. The effect of a weighted damped least-squares solution is investigated to provide user-defined accuracy capabilities along prescribed end-effector space directions. An online estimation algorithm is employed to measure closeness to singular configurations. A feedback correction error term is introduced to ensure algorithm tracking convergence and its effect on the joint velocity solution is discussed. Computational aspects are discussed in view of real-time implementation of the proposed schemes. Experimental case studies are developed to investigate manipulator performance in the case of critical end-effector trajectories passing through and near the shoulder and wrist singularities of the structure.{$<>$}},

  abstract = {Autonomous cyber-physical systems (CPS) can improve safety and efficiency for safety-critical applications, but require rigorous testing before deployment. The complexity of these systems often precludes the use of formal verification and real-world testing can be too dangerous during development. Therefore, simulation-based techniques have been developed that treat the system under test as a black box operating in a simulated environment. Safety validation tasks include finding disturbances in the environment that cause the system to fail (falsification), finding the most-likely failure, and estimating the probability that the system fails. Motivated by the prevalence of safety-critical artificial intelligence, this work provides a survey of state-of-the-art safety validation techniques for CPS with a focus on applied algorithms and their modifications for the safety validation problem. We present and discuss algorithms in the domains of optimization, path planning, reinforcement learning, and importance sampling. Problem decomposition techniques are presented to help scale algorithms to large state spaces, which are common for CPS. A brief overview of safety-critical applications is given, including autonomous vehicles and aircraft collision avoidance systems. Finally, we present a survey of existing academic and commercially available safety validation tools.},

  abstract = {Myopic exploration policies such as epsilon-greedy, softmax, or Gaussian noise fail to explore efficiently in some reinforcement learning tasks and yet, they perform well in many others. In fact, in practice, they are often selected as the top choices, due to their simplicity. But, for what tasks do such policies succeed? Can we give theoretical guarantees for their favorable performance? These crucial questions have been scarcely investigated, despite the prominent practical importance of these policies. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of such policies and provides the first regret and sample-complexity bounds for reinforcement learning with myopic exploration. Our results apply to value-function-based algorithms in episodic MDPs with bounded Bellman Eluder dimension. We propose a new complexity measure called myopic exploration gap, denoted by alpha, that captures a structural property of the MDP, the exploration policy and the given value function class. We show that the sample-complexity of myopic exploration scales quadratically with the inverse of this quantity, 1 / alpha\^2. We further demonstrate through concrete examples that myopic exploration gap is indeed favorable in several tasks where myopic exploration succeeds, due to the corresponding dynamics and reward structure.},

We present an image inpainting method that is based on the celebrated generative adversarial network (GAN) framework. The proposed PGGAN method includes a discriminator network that combines a global GAN (G-GAN) architecture with a patchGAN approach. PGGAN first shares network layers between G-GAN and patchGAN, then splits paths to produce two adversarial losses that feed the generator network in order to capture both local continuity of image texture and pervasive global features in images. The proposed framework is evaluated extensively, and the results including comparison to recent state-of-the-art demonstrate that it achieves considerable improvements on both visual and quantitative evaluations.},

An iterative solution is presented that is suitable for any class of robots having rotary or prismatic joints, with any arbitrary number of degrees of freedom, including both standard and kinematically redundant robots. The solution can be obtained subject to specified constraints and based on certain performance criteria. The solution is based on a new rapidly convergent constrained nonlinear optimization algorithm which uses a modified Newton-Raphson technique for solving a system nonlinear equations. The algorithm is illustrated using as an example a kinematically redundant robot.},

Early attempts at explaining this phenomenon focused on nonlinearity and overfitting. We argue instead that the primary cause of neural networks' vulnerability to adversarial perturbation is their linear nature. This explanation is supported by new quantitative results while giving the first explanation of the most intriguing fact about them: their generalization across architectures and training sets. Moreover, this view yields a simple and fast method of generating adversarial examples. Using this approach to provide examples for adversarial training, we reduce the test set error of a maxout network on the MNIST dataset.},

In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation.

In the past studies of other research groups which focused on the reproducibility of 1D-permeability measurements showed high standard deviations of the gained permeability values (25\%), even though a defined test rig with required specifications was used. Within this study, the reproducibility of capacitive in-plane permeability testing system measurements was benchmarked by comparing results of two research sites using this technology. The reproducibility was compared by using a glass fibre woven textile and carbon fibre non crimped fabric (NCF). These two material types were taken into consideration due to the different electrical properties of glass and carbon with respect to dielectric capacitive sensors of the permeability measurement systems. In order to determine the unsaturated permeability characteristics as function of fibre volume content the measurements were executed at three different fibre volume contents including five repetitions. It was found that the stability and reproducibility of the presented in-plane permeability measurement system is very good in the case of the glass fibre woven textiles. This is true for the comparison of the repetition measurements as well as for the comparison between the two different permeameters. These positive results were confirmed by a comparison to permeability values of the same textile gained with an older generation permeameter applying the same measurement technology.},

  abstract = {Liquid composite molding (LCM) techniques are innovative manufacturing processes for processing fiber reinforced polymer parts used e.g. for aerospace structures. Thereby the reinforcing material is placed in a mold and infiltrated with a low viscosity polymer matrix. Increasing production rates as well as part complexity lead to high production risks such as air inclusions or incomplete mold filling. Numerical mold filling simulations are promising tools enabling the composite manufacturing engineer to detect dry spots in the mold and find the optimal positions of the resin entry and ventilation system at an early process development stage. Today, different numerical models and software packages are available for modeling the flow through the reinforcing structure for visualization of the flow behavior. The goal of this study is the systematic comparison of two different software packages, namely PAM-RTM® and OpenFOAM. Both software tools are operated as they are commonly foreseen. Real world experiments under real process conditions are the basis for the assessment of the numerical predictions.

However, it is common that the total area of a new robot station area must be kept small, or maybe an operator must be able to interact with the station, hence requiring smaller safety zones. In order to reduce these safety zones, integrators need to guarantee that the robot stations design are safe for any type of human behavior by doing a risk assessment and safety evaluation. This will support this risk assessment and safety validation of robot safety zones by developing a function that tries to falsify a station using AI and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to find defects as unexpected collisions in the environment.},

  abstract = {Maritime Autonome Overflate-Skip (MAOS) har potensiale til å bidra til en mer fleksibel urban mobilitetsløsning med reduserte utslipp av drivhusgasser. For å muliggjøre maritim autonomi må systemene gjennomgå grundig sikkerhetsvalidering. Fordi autonome systemer består av flere lag med komplekse systemer som utfører vurdering og beslutningstaking, er ikke tradisjonelle metoder for sikkerhetsvalidering tilstrekkelig for å teste systemene. For å adressere dette problemet har nylig forskning etterlyst nye metoder for å utføre intelligent simuleringsbasert sikkerhetsvalidering av MAOS. Det er foreslått flere metoder for å automatisk identifisere scenarier som er utfordrende for MAOS å navigere i, for å redusere antall nødvendige testscenarier og utføre tilstrekkelig fullstendig testing. Forfatteren har imidlertid ikke funnet noen metoder for bruk i maritim autonomi, som tar for seg måten simuleringen av scenariet utvikler seg. Slike metoder har blitt brukt på autonome kjøretøy og flysystemer ved bruk av metoder som f.eks Adaptive Stress Testing AST. AST er en simuleringsbasert metode som bruker forsterkende læring til å utføre søk etter feil i simuleringer av systemet som testes. Feil blir funnet ved å injisere en sekvens av forstyrrelser og gradvis lære den mest effektive og sannsynlige måten å forstyrre systemet til å svikte. Dette arbeidet foreslår bruk av AST som et trinn i sikkerhetsvalideringsprosessen til MAOS. For å demonstrere metoden brukes AST i tester av to forskjellige kollisjonsunngåelses-strategier i simuleringer av den autonome passassjerfergen milliAmpere. AST utgjør en svært fleksibel metode, da den kan justeres og tilpasses domenet og det spesifikke formålet. Oppgaven foreslår flere slike tilpasninger for å forbedre metoderelevansen for det maritime domenet. Resultatene viser potensialet til AST i sikkerhetsvalideringsprosessen til MAOS, ved at mange interessante feil blir identifisert, hvilke avdekker potensielle aspekter ved de forskjellige kollisjonsunngåelse-systemene hvor det er forbedringspotensiale. Videre forskning bør utføres for å forbedre metoden og for å kombinere AST med scenario-genereringsmetoder.},

  abstract = {For the purpose of compliance with behavioral rules by Autonomous Vehicle (AV), especially in urban traffic, the Behavior-Semantic Scenery Description (BSSD) can be used to describe the limits of the legal behavioral space for each route segment of a road map. In order to test the applicability of BSSD to an online behavior planner, the task of this thesis was to convert selected route segments into the BSSD format, derive behavioral boundaries as formal falsification criteria from the specification of BSSD, and subsequently use them for the application of a Reinforcement Learning (RL) behavior planner.  For this purpose, these criteria were first extracted from the specification, their logical form were identified and formalized. A training environment for the behavior planner including the simulation of other Traffic Participant (TP) and a visualization was created and the falsification criteria and the behavior planner were implemented to the extent as it was possible within the scope of this thesis. Finally, the behavior planner was trained and evaluated.  The formalization and implementation of the falsification criteria highlighted strengths and weaknesses in the machine interpretability of BSSD. Two of the six extracted criteria could not be fully formalized and implemented. For the remaining criteria, however, it was possible to complete this task.  The evaluation of the learned behavior model showed that in the training environment, a vehicle controlled by the simple behavior planner reacts to changes in the maximum permitted speeds and adjusts its speed promptly. Also, lane changes are avoided since they are prohibited or not possible in most places in the selected road section. For compliance with other falsification criteria, improvements must be made to the behavior planner and to the level of penalties for violating the behavior limits respectively rewards for error-free progress. Some suggestions for this have been given in this elaboration.},

  abstract = {Neural networks have become state-of-the-art for computer vision problems because of their ability to efficiently model complex functions from large amounts of data. While neural networks can be shown to perform well empirically for a variety of tasks, their performance is difficult to guarantee. Neural network verification tools have been developed that can certify robustness with respect to a given input image; however, for neural network systems used in closed-loop controllers, robustness with respect to individual images does not address multi-step properties of the neural network controller and its environment. Furthermore, neural network systems interacting in the physical world and using natural images are operating in a black-box environment, making formal verification intractable. This work combines the adaptive stress testing (AST) framework with neural network verification tools to search for the most likely sequence of image disturbances that cause the neural network controlled system to reach a failure. An autonomous aircraft taxi application is presented, and results show that the AST method finds failures with more likely image disturbances than baseline methods. Further analysis of AST results revealed an explainable cause of the failure, giving insight into the problematic scenarios that should be addressed.},

Reinforcement learning is the problem faced by an agent that learns    behavior through trial-and-error interactions with a dynamic    environment.  The work described here has a resemblance to work in    psychology, but differs considerably in the details and in the use of    the word ``reinforcement.''  The paper discusses central issues of    reinforcement learning, including trading off exploration and    exploitation, establishing the foundations of the field via Markov    decision theory, learning from delayed reinforcement, constructing    empirical models to accelerate learning, making use of generalization    and hierarchy, and coping with hidden state.  It concludes with a    survey of some implemented systems and an assessment of the practical    utility of current methods for reinforcement learning.},

  abstract = {Autonomous vehicles have the potential to lower the accident rate when compared to human driving. Moreover, it is the driving force of the automated vehicles' rapid development over the last few years. In the higher Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) automation level, the vehicle's and passengers' safety responsibility is transferred from the driver to the automated system, so thoroughly validating such a system is essential. Recently, academia and industry have embraced scenario-based evaluation as the complementary approach to road testing, reducing the overall testing effort required. It is essential to determine the system's flaws before deploying it on public roads as there is no safety driver to guarantee the reliability of such a system. This paper proposes a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based scenario-based falsification method to search for a high-risk scenario in a pedestrian crossing traffic situation. We define a scenario as risky when a system under testing (SUT) does not satisfy the requirement. The reward function for our RL approach is based on Intel's Responsibility Sensitive Safety(RSS), Euclidean distance, and distance to a potential collision.},

  abstract = {During the development of autonomous systems such as driverless cars, it is important to characterize the scenarios that are most likely to result in failure. Adaptive Stress Testing (AST) provides a way to search for the most-likely failure scenario as a Markov decision process (MDP). Our previous work used a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) solver to identify likely failure scenarios. However, the solver's use of a feed-forward neural network with a discretized space of possible initial conditions poses two major problems. First, the system is not treated as a black box, in that it requires analyzing the internal state of the system, which leads to considerable implementation complexities. Second, in order to simulate realistic settings, a new instance of the solver needs to be run for each initial condition. Running a new solver for each initial condition not only significantly increases the computational complexity, but also disregards the underlying relationship between similar initial conditions. We provide a solution to both problems by employing a recurrent neural network that takes a set of initial conditions from a continuous space as input. This approach enables robust and efficient detection of failures because the solution generalizes across the entire space of initial conditions. By simulating an instance where an autonomous car drives while a pedestrian is crossing a road, we demonstrate the solver is now capable of finding solutions for problems that would have previously been intractable.},

  abstract = {Despite the breakthroughs in accuracy and speed of single image super-resolution using faster and deeper convolutional neural networks, one central problem remains largely unsolved: how do we recover the finer texture details when we super-resolve at large upscaling factors? The behavior of optimization-based super-resolution methods is principally driven by the choice of the objective function. Recent work has largely focused on minimizing the mean squared reconstruction error. The resulting estimates have high peak signal-to-noise ratios, but they are often lacking high-frequency details and are perceptually unsatisfying in the sense that they fail to match the fidelity expected at the higher resolution. In this paper, we present SRGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) for image superresolution (SR). To our knowledge, it is the first framework capable of inferring photo-realistic natural images for 4× upscaling factors. To achieve this, we propose a perceptual loss function which consists of an adversarial loss and a content loss. The adversarial loss pushes our solution to the natural image manifold using a discriminator network that is trained to differentiate between the super-resolved images and original photo-realistic images. In addition, we use a content loss motivated by perceptual similarity instead of similarity in pixel space. Our deep residual network is able to recover photo-realistic textures from heavily downsampled images on public benchmarks. An extensive mean-opinion-score (MOS) test shows hugely significant gains in perceptual quality using SRGAN. The MOS scores obtained with SRGAN are closer to those of the original high-resolution images than to those obtained with any state-of-the-art method.},

The approach places very few requirements on the underlying system, requiring only that the simulator provide some basic controls, the ability to evaluate certain conditions, and a mechanism to control the stochasticity in the system. Access to the system state is not required, allowing the method to support systems with hidden state. The method is applied to stress test a prototype aircraft collision avoidance system to identify trajectories that are likely to lead to near mid-air collisions. We present results for both single and multi-threat encounters and discuss their relevance. Compared with direct Monte Carlo search, this MCTS method performs significantly better both in finding events and in maximizing their likelihood.},

While deep neural network approaches have recently demonstrated remarkable results in terms of synthesis quality, they still come at considerable computational costs (minutes of run-time for low-res images). Our paper addresses this efficiency issue. Instead of a numerical deconvolution in previous work, we precompute a feed-forward, strided convolutional network that captures the feature statistics of Markovian patches and is able to directly generate outputs of arbitrary dimensions. Such network can directly decode brown noise to realistic texture, or photos to artistic paintings. With adversarial training, we obtain quality comparable to recent neural texture synthesis methods. As no optimization is required at generation time, our run-time performance (0.25 M pixel images at 25 Hz) surpasses previous neural texture synthesizers by a significant margin (at least 500 times faster). We apply this idea to texture synthesis, style transfer, and video stylization.},

  abstract = {Planning collision-free and smooth joint motion is crucial in robotic applications, such as welding, milling, and laser cutting. Kinematic redundancy exists when a six-axis industrial robot performs five-dimensional tasks, and there are infinite joint configurations for a six-axis industrial robot to realize a cutter location data of the tool path. The robot joint motion can be optimized by taking advantage of the kinematic redundancy, and the collision-free joint motion with minimum joint movement is determined as the optimal. However, most existing redundancy optimization methods do not fully exploit the redundancy of the six-axis industrial robots when they conduct five-dimensional tasks. In this paper, we present an optimization method to solve the problem of inverse kinematics for a six-axis industrial robot to synthesize the joint motion that follows a given tool path, while achieving smoothness and collision-free manipulation. B-spline is applied for the joint configuration interpolation, and the sum of the squares of the first, second, and third derivatives of the B-spline curves are adopted as the smoothness indicators. Besides, the oriented bounding boxes are adopted to simplify the shape of the robot joints, robot links, spindle unit, and fixtures to facilitate collision detections. Dijkstra's shortest path technique and Differential Evolution algorithm are combined to find the optimal joint motion efficiently and avoid getting into a local optimal solution. The proposed algorithm is validated by simulations on two six-axis industrial robots conducting five-axis flank milling tasks respectively.},

Regular GANs hypothesize the discriminator as a classifier with the sigmoid cross entropy loss function. However, we found that this loss function may lead to the vanishing gradients problem during the learning process. To overcome such a problem, we propose in this paper the Least Squares Generative Adversarial Networks (LSGANs) which adopt the least squares loss function for the discriminator. We show that minimizing the objective function of LSGAN yields minimizing the Pearson X2 divergence. There are two benefits of LSGANs over regular GANs. First, LSGANs are able to generate higher quality images than regular GANs. Second, LSGANs perform more stable during the learning process. We evaluate LSGANs on LSUN and CIFAR-10 datasets and the experimental results show that the images generated by LSGANs are of better quality than the ones generated by regular GANs. We also conduct two comparison experiments between LSGANs and regular GANs to illustrate the stability of LSGANs.},

Robots are very useful for work requiring high accuracy and repeatability. Articulated robots can be as straightforward as a two axis structure or complex with at least ten axes and are typically powered by servo motors. Most industrial robots have four to six axes, with six axes being the most well-known. The aim of this study is to maximize the machine utilization by increasing machine flexibility to increase the level of automation/flexibility. This will ultimately result in reduced operation costs. The programs have been developed for transferring parts to the conveyor, pick-place, and stacking operation for the Aristo 6 Axis Robot using teach mode programming. An optimized robotic movement has also been selected. namely linear point to point movement, spline point to point movement, and corresponding point to point joint movement by observing the possible drawbacks of each mode and subsequently possible effects on the total operational time. Finally, the effect of using the ARISTO Robot for the stacking purpose instead of the operator will be studied by developing the simulation models for both cases on the ARENA simulation software.},

Here, this approach is exemplified for the trajectory planning problem of a particular type of redundant and nonredundant robot manipulators studied under an optimal control problem formulation. For each case, this problem is treated as a minimum energy problem with given kinematics and dynamics and subject to the robot requirements, tasks, and the additional singularities avoidance constraints; resulting in a state constrained continuous optimal control which is solved numerically.},

In this application, the word "composite" simply refers to a matrix of continuous fibers contained within a resin and wrapped over a pressure barrier to form a vessel for gas or liquid containment. COPVs are currently used at NASA to contain high pressure fluids in propulsion, science experiments, and life support applications. They have a significant weight advantage over all metal vessels but require unique design, manufacturing, and test requirements. COPVs also involve a much more complex mechanical understanding due to the interplay between the composite overwrap and the inner liner. A metallic liner is typically used in a COPV as a fluid permeation barrier. The liner design concepts and requirements have been borrowed from all-metal vessels. However, application of metallic vessel design standards to a very thin liner is not straightforward. Different failure modes exist for COPVs than for all-metal vessels, and understanding of these failure modes is at a much more rudimentary level than for metal vessels.},

Especially, if we apply reinforcement learning to engineering, we expect the agent to avoid all penalties. In Markov decision processes, we call a rule penalty if and only if it has a penalty or it can transit to a penalty state where it does not contribute to get any reward. After suppressing all penalty rules, we aim to make a rational policy whose expected reward per action is larger than zero. We propose the penalty avoiding rational policy making algorithm that can suppress any penalty as stable as possible and get a reward constantly. By applying the algorithm to the tick-tack-toe its effectiveness is shown.},

Two key approaches to this problem are reinforcement learning (RL) and planning. This paper presents a survey of the integration of both fields, better known as model-based reinforcement learning. Model-based RL has two main steps. First, we systematically cover approaches to dynamics model learning, including challenges like dealing with stochasticity, uncertainty, partial observability, and temporal abstraction. Second, we present a systematic categorization of planning-learning integration, including aspects like: where to start planning, what budgets to allocate to planning and real data collection, how to plan, and how to integrate planning in the learning and acting loop. After these two sections, we also discuss implicit model-based RL as an end-to-end alternative for model learning and planning, and we cover the potential benefits of model-based RL. Along the way, the survey also draws connections to several related RL fields, like hierarchical RL and transfer learning. Altogether, the survey presents a broad conceptual overview of the combination of planning and learning for MDP optimization.},

Real-world testing, the de facto evaluation environment, places the public in danger, and, due to the rare nature of accidents, will require billions of miles in order to statistically validate performance claims. We implement a simulation framework that can test an entire modern autonomous driving system, including, in particular, systems that employ deep-learning perception and control algorithms. Using adaptive importance-sampling methods to accelerate rare-event probability evaluation, we estimate the probability of an accident under a base distribution governing standard traffic behavior. We demonstrate our framework on a highway scenario, accelerating system evaluation by 2-20 times over naive Monte Carlo sampling methods and 10-300P times (where P is the number of processors) over real-world testing.},

In the existing DRL-based ATCS, the controlled signals collect traffic state information from nearby vehicles, and then optimal actions (e.g., switching phases) can be determined based on the collected information. The DRL models fully "trust" that vehicles are sending the true information to the signals, making the ATCS vulnerable to adversarial attacks with falsified information. In view of this, this paper first time formulates a novel task in which a group of vehicles can cooperatively send falsified information to "cheat" DRL-based ATCS in order to save their total travel time. To solve the proposed task, we develop CollusionVeh, a generic and effective vehicle-colluding framework composed of a road situation encoder, a vehicle interpreter, and a communication mechanism. We employ our method to attack established DRL-based ATCS and demonstrate that the total travel time for the colluding vehicles can be significantly reduced with a reasonable number of learning episodes, and the colluding effect will decrease if the number of colluding vehicles increases. Additionally, insights and suggestions for the real-world deployment of DRL-based ATCS are provided. The research outcomes could help improve the reliability and robustness of the ATCS and better protect the smart mobility systems.},

In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

Using our new techniques, we achieve state-of-the-art results in semi-supervised classification on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN. The generated images are of high quality as confirmed by a visual Turing test: our model generates MNIST samples that humans cannot distinguish from real data, and CIFAR-10 samples that yield a human error rate of 21.3\%. We also present ImageNet samples with unprecedented resolution and show that our methods enable the model to learn recognizable features of ImageNet classes.},

  abstract = {In the future of automated production processes, the manipulator must be more efficient to complete certain tasks. Compared to single-arm robots, dual-arm robots have a larger workspace and stronger load capacity. Coordinated motion planning of multi-arm robots is a problem that must be solved in the process of robot development. This paper proposes an obstacle avoidance path planning method for the dual-arm robot based on the goal probability bias and cost function in a rapidly-exploring random tree algorithm (GA\_RRT). The random tree grows to the goal point with a certain probability. At the same time, the cost function is calculated when the random state is generated. The point with the lowest cost is selected as the child node. This reduces the randomness and blindness of the RRT algorithm in the expansion process. The detection algorithm of the bounding sphere is used in the process of collision detection of two arms. The main arm conducts obstacle avoidance path planning for static obstacles. The slave arm not only considers static obstacles, but also takes on the role of the main arm at each moment as a dynamic obstacle for path planning. Finally, MATLAB is used for algorithm simulation, which proves the effectiveness of the algorithm for obstacle avoidance path planning problems for the dual-arm robot.},

Resin transfer molding (RTM) is a manufacturing process for CFRP that can be scaled up to industrial-sized production.

At runtime, only limited in-process information can be made available for diagnostic insight via a grid of pressure sensors. We propose FlowFrontNet, a deep learning approach to enhance the in-situ process perspective by learning a mapping from sensors to flow front “images” (using upscaling layers), to capture spatial irregularities in the flow front to predict dry spots (using convolutional layers). On simulated data of 6 million single time steps resulting from 36k injection processes, we achieve a time step accuracy of 91.7\% when using a 38 × 30 sensor grid with 1 cm sensor distance in x- and y-direction. On a sensor grid of 10 × 8, with a sensor distance of 4 cm, we achieve 83.7\% accuracy. In both settings, FlowFrontNet provides a significant advantage over direct end-to-end learning models.},

However, the hallucinated details are often accompanied with unpleasant artifacts. To further enhance the visual quality, we thoroughly study three key components of SRGAN - network architecture, adversarial loss and perceptual loss, and improve each of them to derive an Enhanced SRGAN (ESRGAN). In particular, we introduce the Residual-in-Residual Dense Block (RRDB) without batch normalization as the basic network building unit. Moreover, we borrow the idea from relativistic GAN to let the discriminator predict relative realness instead of the absolute value. Finally, we improve the perceptual loss by using the features before activation, which could provide stronger supervision for brightness consistency and texture recovery. Benefiting from these improvements, the proposed ESRGAN achieves consistently better visual quality with more realistic and natural textures than SRGAN and won the first place in the PIRM2018-SR Challenge.

  abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved enormous progress in solving various sequential decision-making problems, such as control tasks in robotics. Since policies are overfitted to training environments, RL methods have often failed to be generalized to safety-critical test scenarios. Robust adversarial RL (RARL) was previously proposed to train an adversarial network that applies disturbances to a system, which improves the robustness in test scenarios. However, an issue of neural network-based adversaries is that integrating system requirements without handcrafting sophisticated reward signals are difficult. Safety falsification methods allow one to find a set of initial conditions and an input sequence, such that the system violates a given property formulated in temporal logic. In this paper, we propose falsification-based RARL (FRARL): this is the first generic framework for integrating temporal logic falsification in adversarial learning to improve policy robustness. By applying our falsification method, we do not need to construct an extra reward function for the adversary. Moreover, we evaluate our approach on a braking assistance system and an adaptive cruise control system of autonomous vehicles. Our experimental results demonstrate that policies trained with a falsification-based adversary generalize better and show less violation of the safety specification in test scenarios than those trained without an adversary or with an adversarial network.},

  abstract = {Aiming at the problem that the 6-DOF manipulator can quickly avoid obstacles in high-dimensional space, the method of path planning based on the improved rapid expansion random tree (RRT) algorithm is proposed. The improved RRT algorithm combines the advantages of the target bias strategy and proposes a method for setting the intermediate bias point. In random sampling, the sampling point is biased to the intermediate bias point,with a certain probability to reduce the blindness of sampling, and use at the same time the path shortening method reduces path nodes and turning points, and optimizes the motion path of the robotic arm. By comparing the simulation results with the RRT and P-RRT algorithms, the effectiveness of the improved RRT algorithm in the calculation time and the number of path nodes is proved.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose the Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Network (SAGAN) which allows attention-driven, long-range dependency modeling for image generation tasks. Traditional convolutional GANs generate high-resolution details as a function of only spatially local points in lower-resolution feature maps. In SAGAN, details can be generated using cues from all feature locations. Moreover, the discriminator can check that highly detailed features in distant portions of the image are consistent with each other. Furthermore, recent work has shown that generator conditioning affects GAN performance. Leveraging this insight, we apply spectral normalization to the GAN generator and find that this improves training dynamics. The proposed SAGAN performs better than prior work1, boosting the best published Inception score from 36.8 to 52.52 and reducing Fre´chet Inception distance from 27.62 to 18.65 on the challenging ImageNet dataset. Visualization of the attention layers shows that the generator leverages neighborhoods that correspond to object shapes rather than local regions of fixed shape.},

  abstract = {Image-to-image translation is a class of vision and graphics problems where the goal is to learn the mapping between an input image and an output image using a training set of aligned image pairs. However, for many tasks, paired training data will not be available. We present an approach for learning to translate an image from a source domain \$X\$ to a target domain \$Y\$ in the absence of paired examples. Our goal is to learn a mapping \$G: X \textbackslash rightarrow Y\$ such that the distribution of images from \$G(X)\$ is indistinguishable from the distribution \$Y\$ using an adversarial loss. Because this mapping is highly under-constrained, we couple it with an inverse mapping \$F: Y \textbackslash rightarrow X\$ and introduce a cycle consistency loss to push \$F(G(X)) \textbackslash approx X\$ (and vice versa). Qualitative results are presented on several tasks where paired training data does not exist, including collection style transfer, object transfiguration, season transfer, photo enhancement, etc. Quantitative comparisons against several prior methods demonstrate the superiority of our approach.},
